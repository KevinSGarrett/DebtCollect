# ==== Cursor House Rules (Python) ====
- Use Python 3.11+.
- Use Ruff for lint + format (line-length 100) and import sort. Keep "ruff check --fix" clean.
- Use MyPy strict for new/changed files. Pass "mypy ." with no errors.
- Use pytest; keep tests fast and deterministic. Shoot for >=85% coverage.
- Keep functions < 50 lines; prefer pure, side-effect-light functions.
- No secrets. Use .env (example provided) and os.environ for config.
- Organize package as "debt_collectibility/*" with clear agents, utils, workflows.
- Document modules (top-level docstring) and public functions (type hints + docstrings).
- Keep SPEC.md and ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md current after major changes.
- Do not modify gates; make code comply.

# ==== Commit Discipline ====
- Small commits tied to passing tests.
- If a test fails, fix or update tests with rationale in commit.
